# Basic Agenda Application

> Creating Agenda using Django and Python 🐍

## 💻 Pre-Requisites

I tested and programed this calculator in Linux (Ubuntu), so i don't know if it will work in other systems.

-   [✓] Linux 🐧
-   [✓] Windows 🪟
-   [Don't have one to test] Mac 🍎

## 🚀 Installing the requirements

To install the project do this, i recommend using a env:

Linux:

```
python3 -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 main.py
```

Windows:

```
???
```
